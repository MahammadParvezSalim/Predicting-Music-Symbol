# Predicting-Music-Symbol
The Music symbols dataset contains 2128 clefs and 1970 accidentals. They were extracted from the modern and old music scores from the 19th century. The main goal of this assignment is to create a neural network that trains on the training data created from this dataset and then test the evaluation on the testing data. The goal is to predict whether a symbol is accidental or clef. For the second part, taking DoubleSharp as the class variable, the tests were conducted to classify them.
